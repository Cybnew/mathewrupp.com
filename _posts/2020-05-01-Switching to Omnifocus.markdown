Lately I've been toying with switching to [OmniFocus.](https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/). I signed up for their two week trial and played around with it enough to dive into it. I will be doing a deep dive into my setup after I use it for about a month. I'll be using the [MacSparky Omnifocus Field Guide](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/omnifocus) as inspiration for my setup but we will see where it goes from there.

Hope everyone is staying safe out there
