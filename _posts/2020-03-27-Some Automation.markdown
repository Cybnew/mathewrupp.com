## I've been playing around with automating some

The ones I have been playing with today have been automating the creation of these posts. With a few key commands I can create a new file in drafts (my capture software of choice) with the proper front matter for Jekyll (my blog platform), prompt me for a title and categories, and then paste it all in the new draft. Once I'm done writing I can type another set of keystrokes and have it copy the text to sublime text and save it as a markdown file in the right folder. The automation is complex for such a simple task but it really streamlines the process.
