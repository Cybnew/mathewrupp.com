# Looking into improving my workflow for storing reference material

Lately I’ve become interested in refining my workflow for storing reference material. Back in 2013/2014 I became heavily invested in an [Evernote]()(https://evernote.com) based system, however, in the last few years I’ve become frustrated with the increase in cost combined with the decrease in features/quality. This left me without a system for a while and my file management system has paid the price. Therefore I’ve decided to reevaluate the benefits of a system like Evernote. While looking for alternatives I came across [Devonthink]()(https://www.devontechnologies.com/). I’ve downloaded the trial for Devonthink and  will be playing with it over the next couple of weeks. I’m going to duplicate everything I add to Devonthink in Evernote and compare them at the end of my trial. I’ll update after the trial ends
