## Something that's been frustrating me lately.

Look, I get that the president is unpopular. I don’t care for him either, but lately I seem to be put in the position of defending him because people are sharing wrong or misleading stuff about him. 

He does plenty of stupid shit that merits criticism, let’s not add bullshit to the mix. It just muddies the water. Some of you may say “who cares? He’s a horrible person” and my response to that is the truth is often enough to condemn actions. 

If you spread wrong or misleading stuff because you don’t do due diligence, you are acting in a manner that is no better than his. Be better. 

I’m tired of defending him because people won’t do their research. This isn’t targeted at anyone in particular, I’ve just noticed a lot of wrong or misleading information that can be proven so with a quick google search. 

Next time you want to post something disparaging about the current political leadership, consider posting something positive about people’s actions during this time. 

Heathcare workers helping people, Business going out of there way to take care of employees, People donating time and energy to help make medical equipment. 

These are the stories worthy of sharing. Be better than him.
